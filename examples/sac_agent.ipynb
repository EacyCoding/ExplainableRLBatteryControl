    "To control an environment like CityLearn that has continuous states and actions, tabular Q-learning is not practical, as it suffers from the _curse of dimensionality_. Actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) methods use artificial neural networks to generalize across the state-action space. The actor network maps the current states to the actions that it estimates to be optimal. Then, the critic network evaluates those actions by mapping them, together with the states under which they were taken, to the Q-values.\n",

    "Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a model-free off-policy RL algorithm. As an off-policy method, SAC can reuse experience and learn from fewer samples. SAC is based on three key elements: an actor-critic architecture, off-policy updates, and entropy maximization for efficient exploration and stable training. SAC learns three different functions: the actor (policy), the critic (soft Q-function), and the value function.\n",

    "We will now initialize a new environment and plug it to an SAC agent to help us solve our control problem. Luckily, we do not have to write our own implementation of the SAC algorithm. Instead, we can make use of Python libraries that have standardized the implementation of a number of RL algorithms. One of such libraries that we will use is [Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). At the time of writing, there are [13 different RL algorithms](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/algos.html#rl-algorithms) implemented between Stable Baselines3 and Stable-Baselines3 - Contrib (contrib package for Stable-Baselines3 - experimental reinforcement learning code), including SAC.\n",
