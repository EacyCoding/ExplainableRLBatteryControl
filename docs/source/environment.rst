CityLearn allows controlling the storage of domestic hot water (DHW), chilled water (for sensible space cooling), hot water (for sensible space heating) and electrical energy. CityLearn also includes models of air-to-water heat pumps, electric heaters, solar photovoltaic arrays, batteries and the pre-computed energy loads of the buildings, which include space cooling, space heating, DHW, appliances, and solar generation.

The models are grouped to form a building model and a cluster of buildings form a district which, demand response strategies may be evaluated upon.
